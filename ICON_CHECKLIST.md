# Babcia Icon Checklist (v2, aligned to PRD.md)

Purpose: This is the authoritative icon list for Babcia UI. It is aligned to PRD.md (Pierogi Protocol). The goal is to replace all SF Symbols used in the app with Babcia-style icons while keeping layout unchanged.

Style Rules (Required)
- Single-color glyphs (no gradients, no shadows, no strokes with alpha).
- Rounded corners, consistent stroke weight (1.5-2.0 pt).
- Round caps and joins for strokes.
- Designed on a 24x24 pt grid (preferred). 25x25 pt acceptable if you keep it consistent.
- Should read clearly at 20-22 pt and 32-44 pt.
- Provide a solid filled version for each icon unless noted.

Export Specs (Important)
- Color: use solid black (#000000) as the fill so iOS can tint it (template rendering).
- Transparency: background fully transparent; no semi-transparent strokes or fills.
- Artboard: 24x24 pt (preferred) with the glyph visually centered.
- Exports: vector PDF (preferred). If PNG: @1x/@2x/@3x (24/48/72 px).

Notes
- If you want absolute uniformity, design a single 24×24 grid system with consistent stroke widths and corner radius.
- Use the same visual weight across all icons so glass cards feel balanced.
- Keep negative space generous so icons remain legible at small sizes.
