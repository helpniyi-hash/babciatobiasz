Project Rules (BabciaTobiasz)
============================

Non‑Negotiables
- No minimal fixes, no shortcuts, no "Frankenstein" patches.
- Changes must be thorough, consistent, and clean.
- iOS only. Do not add or support macOS targets.
- UI is the priority; backend can be adapted later.
- If a change is partial or mismatched, redo it properly.

Build/Run
- Use the physical device (ilovepoxmox) for verification by default.
- Simulator is optional and only for quick checks when needed.
- Always confirm the UI matches the intended reference before moving on.
