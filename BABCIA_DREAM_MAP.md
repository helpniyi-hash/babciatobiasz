# BABCIA: THE DREAM MAP
**The Visionary Roadmap from Concept to Global ADHD Lifeline.**

---

## Phase 1: The Hearth (Foundation)
*   **Design System Locking**: Finalize the "Liquid Glass" kit (MeshGradients, GlassCards, Linux Libertine).
*   **The Emotional Menu**: Implementation of the three core personas (Wellness, Warrior, Baroness) and JITAI switching logic.
*   **The App Host**: Robust iOS architecture designed to scale with advanced physics and AI modules.

## Phase 2: The Kitchen (The Core Engine)
*   **AI Vision Integration**: Real-world photo capture and "Rule of 5" decomposition into tasks.
*   **The Reverse Tamagotchi**: Establishing the "App feeds User" logic where environmental cleanlines = user fullness.
*   **The Emotional Approval Loop**: Introducing the "Pleasing Grandma" layer for secondary behavioral reinforcement.

## Phase 3: The Feast (The Satisfying Physicality)
*   **3D Pierogi Proxies**: Tasks become physical 3D objects with weight, mass, and satisfying "thud" physics.
*   **Sensory Gating**: High-fidelity audio (Crunch/Burp) and folk-party visual celebrations.
*   **Variable Rewards**: Implementation of the Slot Machine logic (Golden Pierogis and Cheat Cards).

## Phase 4: The Pantry (The Economy)
*   **Ingredient Crafting**: A deep progression system where tasks drop Flour, Dil, Saffron, and more.
*   **Dream Vision Filters**: Using the economy to unlock AI filters that morph "After" photos into Cozy Cottages, Comic Books, and Sci-Fi landscapes.
*   **The Inventory View**: A tactile, glass-based "Pantry" for long-term progress visualization.

## Phase 5: The Protocol (The Safety Net)
*   **The Kitchen Closed Mode**: Hard burnout protection through enforced cool-down periods and kitchen "dimming" effects.
*   **Consistency over Perfection**: Refined AI auditing that never punishes but always redirects.
*   **The Trust Meter**: Adaptive verification rates that learn user reliability over time.

## Phase 6: The Matrix (Streaming & Continuity)
*   **The Remote Coaching System**: Building the "Streaming Cameras" provider interface (Tapo, RTSP, HA).
*   **Ambient Monitoring**: Babcia can check on the grandchild without manual intervention, removing initiation friction.
*   **Zero-Motion Verification**: Frames are pulled directly from local network streams for instant "Plate Clearing."

**The Goal:** A world where neurodivergent brains don't feel ashamed of a mess, but excited to "be fed" and "make Babcia proud."
